# About
This project has been a teasting playground for:
  - evaluating [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) capabilities in for golang
  - getting my feet wet at using [resty](https://github.com/go-resty/resty) library as an http client.

# How's Codeium faring?
Pretty darn good, I have been pleasantly impressed. Read the full [experience](https://github.com/LucaWolf/shakemon/docs/) 
on this mini project to see what it has been capable of.
