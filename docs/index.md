# Background story

I wanted to investigate how AI could help me in my coding endeavors. Using an older version of a dummy application, I started
replicating a simple web service that takes a Pokemon character name as parameter and returns a Shakespearean translation of its 
description. For reference, the  full project code is available at my [shakemon](https://github.com/LucaWolf/shakemon) repository.

I've had already some experience with the scope of this exercise, in particular of what APIs and modules 
([GorillaMux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) and [Resty](https://github.com/go-resty/resty)) I wanted to use and the basic flow of the application. 

The only question remaining was how would [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) AI system help me when I threw at it all this information.

# Setup and usage
I have used the VS Code as text editor and the [plugin](https://codeium.com/vscode_tutorial) provided for it. Upon installing the extension,
the first use is going to be prompting you to login (I have used my google account) and then present you with an 
`{...}` icon in the extensions panel. Expand it and start interacting the prompt, it is as simple as that.

> **NOTE**
> not only Codeium generates blocks of code but also renders a decent description of what those source code do
and supplements it with some recommendations.


# The `main` entry point
 So let's start by issuing "demands":

>> Sure! Here's an example of a Gorilla Mux server with a GET endpoint that takes two path parameters:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"

)

func main() {
    r := mux.NewRouter()

```

Decent enough! Let me make some scope adjustments and stub out the desired functionality. 
Basically I want to get a description by name and then a "classy" translation. So it then looked like this:

```go
// route declaration in main
r.HandleFunc("/translate/{kind}/{name}", translatePokemon).Methods("GET")

// route handler
func translatePokemon(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	vars := mux.Vars(r)
	kind := vars["kind"]
	name := vars["name"]

	if kind != "pokemon" { return some json error body and http.StatusBadRequest }

	// grab some official description
	if description, err := getDescription(name); err != nil {		
		return some error body and http.StatusFailedDependency }
	
	// use the Bard
	} else if translation, err := getTranslation(description); err != nil {		
		return some error body and http.StatusFailedDependency }

	// finally return the expectations
	else {		
		return result(translation) and http.StatusOK 
	}
}

```
I won't get into what errors and positive outcome are, basically simple json bodies with the inherited errors or data
(search `apiErrorDetails` and `apiReply` in the source code for reference).
What I needed now was the implementation of `getDescription` and `getTranslation`.


# Making of `getDescription`
I had issued this command and got back:

Very nice. I'd like to make it slightly mine though, so let's just call `SetResult(PokemonAPIResponse{})` on the `client.R()` request to let the 
library do the heavy lifting on the json parsing. I don't care about of the `200` http code test for now, there is always room for improvement later on.

 ðŸ¤¯ **Mind blown that**:
 - it listed the right API endpoint from input of `pokemon` and `description` tokens (keywords) only.
 - it built path parameters for the API request correctly.
 - was able to build the `PokemonAPIResponse` response structure compatible with the API's definition
   (wherever it took it from, online or "trained memory"). I did not have any local reference to that API though I have an older similar project in Github.
 - the embedded `struct` in `struct` definition of `PokemonAPIResponse` took me by surprise; I wasn't fully aware of this syntax being allowed.
 - the produced code compiled and worked correctly, even before adding any of my changes.
 - it automatically filtered the results by English `en` language <ins>without asking</ins> for this requirement ðŸ˜². This context awareness is somewhat scary, 
   unless this functionality has been put forward in a lot of interviews :-) and is likely very well known and scores high on token references.

Perhaps was due to the my simple way of expressing the request but this API endpoint was supposed to take a POST request
(thus using  `client.R().SetFormData` method instead of `SetQueryParams`). I also adjusted the usual json response parsing and reworked a bit the return block.

Nonetheless, the provided code was a solid starting base. My adjusted version reads:

```go
{
	// POST instead of GET
	resp, err := client.R().
		SetFormData(map[string]string{
			"text": text,
		}).
		SetError(apiError{}).
		SetResult(TranslationAPIResponse{}).
		Post("https://api.funtranslations.com/translate/shakespeare.json")

	...
	// replace the http.Code 200 tests
	if resp.IsError() {
		err, _ := resp.Error().(*apiError)
		return "", &err.Error
	}

	// Extract the description from the API response
	data, ok := resp.Result().(*TranslationAPIResponse)
	if !ok {
		return "", errors.New("response was not a Translation API format")
	}

	if len(data.Contents.Translated) == 0 {
		return "", errors.New("no translation found")
	}

	return data.Contents.Translated, nil
}

```

# Playing with json unmarshalling
At this point, after a few debug/testing sessions, I realized that there is a divergence between the applications API error type `apiErrorDetails`
returned by the endpoint handler (as inspired by MS Graph and using `Code` formatted as `string` => some meaningful message) and 
the error returned by the translation service (similar but using `Code` as `integer` => the http.code value). 
In order to consolidate them, I've applied the "polymorphic" unmarshalling trick,
 i.e. type wrapping the `Code` into own type `StringOrInt` and implementing a bespoke parsing routine over it. 
 
So my request to the AI engine was:
> implement json deserialisation for type StringOrInt. When string copy as is, when integer convert into string.
>>
>> To implement JSON deserialization for a type `StringOrInt` where a string is copied as is and an integer is converted into a string, you can define a custom 
>> unmarshal method for the type. Here's an example:

```go 
type StringOrInt struct {
	Value string
}

func (s *StringOrInt) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error {
	var rawValue interface{}
	err := json.Unmarshal(data, &rawValue)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	switch v := rawValue.(type) {
	case string:
		s.Value = v
	case float64:
		s.Value = strconv.FormatFloat(v, 'f', -1, 64)
	case int:
		s.Value = strconv.Itoa(v)
	default:
		return fmt.Errorf("unexpected value type: %T", v)
	}

	return nil
}

func main() {
	jsonData := `{"value": "hello"}`
	var obj StringOrInt
	err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(jsonData), &obj)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Value:", obj.Value)
	}

	jsonData = `{"value": 42}`
	err = json.Unmarshal([]byte(jsonData), &obj)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Value:", obj.Value)
	}
}

```
>> In this example, we define the `StringOrInt` struct with a `Value` field of type `string`. We then implement the `UnmarshalJSON` method for the `StringOrInt`

Excellent implementation, with usage example on top! But me being picky, I wanted the `StringOrInt` type to exclude inner fields as I don't like multiple
 dereferencing (e.g. `obj.Value`). Therefore I issued a more explicit request:

> refactor StringOrInt so is a simple type StringOrInt string redefinition. Unmarshal should accommodate this type overload
>>
>>Certainly! Here's an updated version of the `StringOrInt` type with a custom `UnmarshalJSON` method that handles the overloaded type:

```go
type StringOrInt string

func (s *StringOrInt) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error {
	var rawValue interface{}
	err := json.Unmarshal(data, &rawValue)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	switch v := rawValue.(type) {
	case string:
		*s = StringOrInt(v)
	case float64:
		*s = StringOrInt(strconv.FormatFloat(v, 'f', -1, 64))
	case int:
		*s = StringOrInt(strconv.Itoa(v))
	default:
		return fmt.Errorf("unexpected value type: %T", v)
	}

	return nil
}

// same usage example 
func main() {...}
```

>> In this updated example, we redefine `StringOrInt` as a simple type of `string`. We then implement the `UnmarshalJSON` method for the `StringOrInt` type. 
>> Inside the method, we handle the overloaded type by switching on the type of the raw value and assigning it to the `StringOrInt` variable `s`. 
>> We convert `float64` and `int` values to strings using `strconv`.


# Pass me the error
Finally, I wanted to have the `apiErrorDetails` (as possibly returned by the Shakespeare translating service) implement the Golang's error interface. 
Usually, this is useful when logging or bubbling up a bespoke type as an error. So here I went again (notice the casual "i/face" thrown at the AI engine):


> make apiErrorDetails implement the Error i/face
>>
>> To make the `apiErrorDetails` struct implement the `error` interface in Go, you need to define an `Error` method on the struct. Here's an example:

```go
type apiErrorDetails struct {
	Code    int    `json:"code"`
	Message string `json:"message"`
}

func (e *apiErrorDetails) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("API Error: Code=%d, Message=%s", e.Code, e.Message)
}

func main() {
	err := &apiErrorDetails{
		Code:    404,
		Message: "Page not found",
	}

	fmt.Println(err.Error())
}

```

# Conclusions
It is difficult and not accurate to draw ultimate conclusions based on single runs and such simple tests. But here are my initial impressions:

- I consider to have had a positive outcome of this AI interaction
- almost feels like a non-judgemental peer programming buddy
- several layers of re-factoring are available.
- it is fast. It may take seconds to crunch the data but then it outputs "many" (each engine has a hard limit) lines of code like nothing. How fast can you type?
- is up to you as user to ask for iterative changes, refactoring and honing down to an acceptable (correct, to your taste and liking) level of implementation.
- empirically, it saved me between 30% to 50% of development time. Realistically, would be even more when it gets down to writing documentation, 
 unit tests and other time consuming cruft.
- needless to say but don't trust the generated output 100%. Always validate and review the produced code. 
  It seems very good at seeing "the trees for the forest" but not so good as seeing "the forest" or the whole ecosystem.
- would I use it for personal (toy) projects and learning experience? Heck yes!
- would I use this (or alternatives) for work? Absolutely, subject to the powers to be adopting such an AI provider.
- beware addictions: it seems so fast and helpful in assisting with refactoring that you may be tempted to jump straight into it and 
  attempt "changing the world" (aka your project) . Whilst the whole evolution and even the learning model is based on iterations, 
  not all refactoring is good or worthwhile... so get a life people.
